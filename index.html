    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
    <h3>The Man</h3>
        <p>
        HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim
        Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to
        share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
        <p>
          In addition to hosting most of the world's supply of kitten videos, the Web is also full of inspiring quotes, perhaps none more so than this one:
        </p>
        <blockquote style="padding: 2px 20px; background: #FDF1D9;">
          <p>
            <em>Don't believe every quote you read on the Internet.</em>
            <br>
            -Abraham Lincoln
          </p>
